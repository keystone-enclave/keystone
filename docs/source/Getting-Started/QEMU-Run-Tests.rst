.. _LaunchQEMU:

Run Tests
--------------------------------------

Now, you're ready to use QEMU to boot Keystone Security Monitor and Linux on top of it.

Simply running following command will build and run tests in QEMU.

::

  make run-tests

If you wish to compile and run tests by your self, follow the following instructions.

Build Test Binaries
#############################

Simple tests live under ``tests/tests``.
You can build the tests by executing ``tests/tests/vault.sh`` (See :doc:`../Building-Components/Vault`).

::

  ./tests/tests/vault.sh

This command will generate the enclave package named ``tests.ke`` in
``buildroot_overlay/root/tests`` directory.

Build Disk Image (initrd)
#############################

Next, you need to copy the enclave package into the disk image that you're going to boot on.

We use `Buildroot Overlay <https://buildroot.org/downloads/manual/manual.html#rootfs-custom>`_ for
injecting the test binaries into the disk image.
The buildroot overlay directory is ``buildroot_overlay``.

::

  make image

This command will re-generate the Linux kernel with ``initrd`` containing overlay root file system
in ``buildroot_overlay``.

Launch QEMU
#############################

The following script will run QEMU, start executing from the emulated silicon root of trust.
The root of trust then jumps to the SM, and the SM boots Linux!

::

   ./scripts/run-qemu.sh

Login as ``root`` with the password ``sifive``.


You can exit QEMU by ``ctrl-a``+``x`` or using ``poweroff`` command

Note that the launch scripts for QEMU will start ssh on a random
forwarded localhost port (this is to allow multiple qemu test runs on
the same development machine). The script will print what port it has
forwarded ssh to on start.

Insert Keystone Driver
##################################

Insert the keystone driver.

::

    insmod keystone-driver.ko

Run Tests
##################################

`fast-setup.sh` or `setup.sh` script has already built the SDK and small test enclaves and put the binaries into the buildroot root file system.
The source code of test enclaves are in `sdk/examples/tests` directory.

You can run the test enclaves by using a self-extracting keystone archive called `tests.ke` generated by the SDK.

::

  cd ./tests
  ./tests.ke
